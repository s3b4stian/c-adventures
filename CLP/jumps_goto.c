// -  the label mentioned within the goto statement must be defined somewhere inside the enclosing function body; 
//    this also means that the goto statement must not lead to:
//      - outside a function;
//      - inside other function.
// -  any label defined within a particular function doesnâ€™t have to be used in the goto statement.
// -  jump is possible backward and forward
// -  a goto statement may lead to the outside of a compound statement
